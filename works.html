							  <div class="shw-cs2"> About Parkinson's Disease </div>
							  <div class="shw-cs4"> Parkinson’s disease is a brain disorder that leads to shaking, stiffness and difficulty with walking and coordination. The symptoms gradually get worse, and our team is working to prevent that. Parkinson’s is caused by a loss of nerve cells in the part of the brain known as the Substantia Nigra. The cells located in this part of the brain are also responsible for the production of Dopamine in our bodies, so with a loss of these cells patients go through high levels of stress and depression. There are 5 stages to Parkinson’s disease, and they are as follows: <br>
<b> Stage One: </b> Individuals experience mild symptoms that generally do not interfere with daily activities. Tremor and other movement symptoms occur on one side of the body only. =They may also experience changes in posture, walking and facial expressions. <br>
<b>Stage Two: </b> Symptoms worsen, including tremor, rigidity and other movement symptoms on both sides of the body. The person is still able to live alone, but daily tasks are more difficult and lengthier. <br>
<b>Stage Three: </b> This is considered mid-stage. Individuals experience loss of balance and slowness of movements. While still fully independent, these symptoms significantly impair activities such as dressing and eating. Falls are also more common by stage three. <br>
<b>Stage Four: </b> Symptoms are severe and limiting. Individuals may stand without help, but movement likely requires a walker. People in stage four require help with daily activities and are unable to live alone. <br>
<b>Stage Five: </b> Stiffness in the legs may make it impossible to stand or walk. The person requires a wheelchair or is bedridden. Around-the-clock nursing care is needed for all activities. The person may experience hallucinations and delusions.

							  <div class="shw-cs2"> About BCI </div>
							  <div class="shw-cs4"> BCI’s are devices that interact with and improve the function of our Central Nervous System. These devices can change the way that our brain and neural waves function. They are implanted into different parts of the brain via surgery that will now be performed by an AI. BCI’s also change the way we interact with technology. Communication will be something like it never was before, a mere video call could be just a couple thoughts away. Need a photo but you don’t have your phone with you? That's just fine, Blink and that image will now be stored in a database accessible to you. They are also being used to find cures for conditions the human race has been struggling with for a long time. Devices are being developed that will offer a road to rehabilitation for those with paralysis, along with devices that allow Deep Brain Simulations and Tremors which helps with the treatment of Parkinson’s Disease. That’s where we come in.

							  <div class="shw-cs2"> Using BCI to cure Parkinson's Disease </div>
							  <div class="shw-cs4"> We are using BCI’s that will be implanted at the base of the Substantia Nigra to create Deep Brain Stimulation and Deep Brain Tremors which helps the nerve cells regenerate and create more dopamine. Neurons create dopamine when an electrical impulce is sent though the neuron. We can attatch a microtransmitter (used for neurons) to the cells which are not producing enough dopamine. When is sences that enough dopamine is not being produced, it will continuously send electric impulces to the neurons until enough dopamine is created. For many years, the pharmaceutical industry has tried to develop new drugs and antibiotics that help with Parkinson’s but have only partially succeeded. Several Anticholinergics have been developed and used which suppress the tremors and shaking that patients endure only for short periods of time. This causes the for patients to need more medication over time which becomes costlier and makes it incredibly difficult. With Neurify, we will have a garantee for curing Parkinson's Disease.
